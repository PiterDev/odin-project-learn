    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
        It's a cupcake and it's vanilla flavored.
    </p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>  
        <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners. </li>

        <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full. </li>
        
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
    </ol>
